    <h1>TAJ MAHAL</h1>
    <p>ðŸ•Œ Taj Mahal â€“ The Symbol of Eternal Love

The Taj Mahal, located in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, is one of the Seven Wonders of the World and a masterpiece of Mughal architecture. It was built by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died in 1631. Construction began in 1632 and took about 22 years to complete, with over 20,000 artisans working on it.

Made entirely of white marble, the Taj Mahal shines differently at different times of the day â€” pinkish in the morning, milky white in the evening, and golden under the moonlight. The monument complex includes a beautiful garden, a reflecting pool, a mosque, and guest houses, all laid out symmetrically.

The Taj Mahal is not just an architectural wonder but also a symbol of love, beauty, and devotion. In 1983, it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting millions of visitors from around the world every year.</p>

    <h1>HAWA MAHAL</h1>
    <p>🏰 Hawa Mahal – The Palace of Winds

The Hawa Mahal, or “Palace of Winds,” is one of the most iconic landmarks in Jaipur, Rajasthan. Built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, it was designed by the architect Lal Chand Ustad in the form of Lord Krishna’s crown.

Made of red and pink sandstone, Hawa Mahal is a five-story structure with 953 small windows called “jharokhas.” These windows were designed to allow cool air to flow through the palace, keeping it comfortable even during the hot summers — hence the name “Palace of Winds.”

The main purpose of the Hawa Mahal was to allow royal women to observe daily life and street festivals below without being seen, following the strict customs of purdah at the time.

Today, the Hawa Mahal stands as a symbol of Jaipur’s royal heritage, blending Rajput and Mughal architectural styles beautifully. From its top floors, visitors can enjoy breathtaking views of the City Palace and Jantar Mantar.</p>

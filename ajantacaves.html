    <h1>AJANTA CAVES</h1>
    <p>🏞️ Ajanta Caves – The Timeless Treasure of Indian Art

The Ajanta Caves, located near Aurangabad in Maharashtra, are among India’s greatest historical and artistic achievements. These rock-cut caves were built between the 2nd century BCE and 6th century CE, and they beautifully reflect the skill and devotion of ancient Indian craftsmen and artists.

There are 30 caves in total, carved into a horseshoe-shaped cliff along the Waghora River. The caves served as Buddhist monasteries and prayer halls (viharas and chaityas). Inside, they are adorned with magnificent paintings, murals, and sculptures that depict the life of the Buddha and stories from the Jataka tales.

The paintings of Ajanta are world-famous for their graceful lines, expressive faces, and vibrant natural colors — they are among the finest examples of ancient Indian art.

Today, the Ajanta Caves are a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting visitors and historians from around the globe. They stand as a symbol of India’s rich spiritual and artistic heritage.</p>

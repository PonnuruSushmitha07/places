    <h1>GOLDEN TEMPLE</h1>
    <p>🛕 Golden Temple – The Heart of Amritsar

The Golden Temple, also known as Sri Harmandir Sahib, is the holiest shrine of Sikhism and one of the most stunning monuments in India. Located in Amritsar, Punjab, it was founded by Guru Ram Das Ji in the late 16th century and later completed by Guru Arjan Dev Ji, the fifth Sikh Guru.

The temple is built in the middle of a sacred pool called the Amrit Sarovar, which means “Pool of Nectar.” Its upper floors are covered with pure gold, giving the temple its world-famous name and breathtaking appearance.

The Golden Temple stands as a symbol of equality, peace, and spiritual unity — people of all religions, backgrounds, and walks of life are welcome here. The temple complex also houses the world’s largest community kitchen (Langar), which serves free meals to over 50,000 visitors daily, regardless of caste, creed, or religion.

Today, the Golden Temple is not just a place of worship but also a symbol of humanity, humility, and devotion, reflecting the true essence of Sikh faith.</p>

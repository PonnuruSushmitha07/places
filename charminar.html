    <h1>CHARMINAR</h1>
    <p>🕌 Charminar – The Icon of Hyderabad

The Charminar, located in the heart of Hyderabad, Telangana, is one of India’s most famous historical landmarks and a true symbol of the city’s culture and heritage.

Built in 1591 by Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the founder of Hyderabad, the Charminar was constructed to commemorate the end of a deadly plague that once ravaged the city. The name “Charminar” comes from two Urdu words — Char meaning “four” and Minar meaning “towers.”

This majestic monument features four grand minarets, each standing 56 meters tall, with intricate carvings and arches that showcase the brilliance of Indo-Islamic architecture. Surrounding the Charminar is the bustling Laad Bazaar, famous for bangles, pearls, and traditional Hyderabadi delicacies.

Today, the Charminar stands as a timeless symbol of Hyderabad, representing its history, art, and culture — a must-visit for anyone exploring the “City of Pearls.”</p>

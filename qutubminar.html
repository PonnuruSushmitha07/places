    <h1>QUTUB MINAR</h1>
    <p>üè∞ Qutub Minar ‚Äì The Tower of Victory

The Qutub Minar, located in Delhi, is one of India‚Äôs most famous historical monuments and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Standing at a height of 73 meters, it is the tallest brick minaret in the world.

Construction of the Qutub Minar was started in 1192 by Qutub-ud-din Aibak, the founder of the Delhi Sultanate, and later completed by his successor Iltutmish. The tower was built to celebrate Muslim dominance in Delhi after the defeat of the last Hindu kingdom.

Made of red sandstone and marble, the minaret has five stories, each marked by a projecting balcony. The walls are beautifully decorated with intricate carvings and verses from the Quran. Next to it stands the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, one of the oldest mosques in India, and the mysterious Iron Pillar, which has not rusted for over 1,600 years.

Today, the Qutub Minar stands as a magnificent example of Indo-Islamic architecture and remains a major tourist attraction that reflects India‚Äôs rich historical heritage.</p>

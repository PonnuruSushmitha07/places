    <h1>Hampi</h1>
    <p>üèØ Hampi ‚Äì The Glorious Ruins of the Vijayanagara Empire

Hampi, located in the state of Karnataka, is one of India‚Äôs most spectacular historical and archaeological sites. It was once the magnificent capital of the Vijayanagara Empire, one of the greatest Hindu kingdoms in South India, flourishing between the 14th and 16th centuries.

The ruins of Hampi stretch across vast rocky landscapes, dotted with temples, palaces, market streets, and monuments that showcase the brilliance of ancient Indian architecture and culture. Among its most famous attractions are the Virupaksha Temple, Vittala Temple (known for its musical pillars and stone chariot), and the Hampi Bazaar.

In 1986, UNESCO declared Hampi a World Heritage Site, recognizing its historical, cultural, and architectural importance. Though much of the city lies in ruins today, it continues to inspire visitors with its grandeur, artistry, and spiritual atmosphere.</p>

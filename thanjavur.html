    <h1>THANJAVUR</h1>
    <p>🛕 Thanjavur – The Cultural Capital of Tamil Nadu

Thanjavur, also known as Tanjore, is a historic city located in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. It is often called the “Rice Bowl of Tamil Nadu” and is world-famous for its rich culture, art, music, and architecture.

The city rose to prominence during the reign of the Chola dynasty (9th–13th centuries) and became a center of learning and culture. The most iconic monument of Thanjavur is the Brihadeeswarar Temple, also known as the Big Temple, built by Raja Raja Chola I in the 11th century. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is an architectural marvel made entirely of granite, with a towering Vimana (temple tower) that stands over 66 meters tall.

Thanjavur is also renowned for its Tanjore paintings, classical Carnatic music, and handicrafts that reflect the city’s artistic heritage. The Saraswathi Mahal Library here holds ancient manuscripts and rare books, making it a treasure for scholars.

Today, Thanjavur remains a vibrant blend of tradition and modernity, preserving the legacy of South India’s glorious past.</p>

🇮🇳 India Gate – The Symbol of Pride and Sacrifice

The India Gate, located in New Delhi, is one of India’s most famous war memorials and an enduring symbol of national pride. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, it was built in 1931 to honor the 70,000 Indian soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the British Army during World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War.

Standing 42 meters tall, the monument resembles the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. The names of more than 13,000 soldiers are inscribed on its walls. Beneath the arch lies the Amar Jawan Jyoti, or “Flame of the Immortal Soldier,” which was added after India’s independence to honor the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives during the Indo-Pak war of 1971.

Surrounded by lush green lawns, India Gate is not only a historical monument but also a popular spot for gatherings and celebrations, especially during Republic Day and Independence Day.</p>
